                    <p>When it comes to the sport of Disc Golf the rules are important. So, I have researched and put together a list of rules that should be followed when beginning to play disc golf. Please note these rules are not in order from most to least important and can be changed according to the settings in which you are playing. Lets begin with the objective of the game. The objective of disc golf is to play the least of amount of disc golf possible. What do I mean? Much like regular golf the person with the lowest score after 18 holes will typically be crowned the winner of the game. Plain and simple the objective of the game is to get the disc in the basket or hole in the lowest number of throws. Now lets talk about how to play. The order which you play will be the person who has the least number of throws on the previous hole or the person who is the furthest from the hole after the tee throw. To start there will be a designated tee area. From this area you may not pass the outlined area when throwing the disc to start the game. Once the disc is in play you will mark where the disc landed or leave that disc on the ground and throw from that spot on your next turn. At no point may you past the disc on the ground to throw for you next turn. Within 10 feet of the hole, you may not lean forward to place the disc in the basket. Other rules such as Fairway Throws, Mandatory or Mandos, and out of bounds can be followed. However, we will not cover these in this section.</p>
